        <p>
        Hello, I am Sean. I am here to practise my ability to make webpages.
         <strong>However that is not the only thing I am interested in</strong> 
        I Enjoy all the typical nerd things 
        like Dungeons and Dragons and video games.
        I try to be outgoing, to a lot of people im loud and always happy,
         even though in reality im the opposite.

        </p>
